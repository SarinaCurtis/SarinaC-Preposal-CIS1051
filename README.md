# What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I honestly really do not know what I would like to do for my final project, but I am leaning towards either a game or a web based project (If I am able to work with JavaScript)
# If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I am not collaborating with anyone 
# Do you have any questions of your own?
I learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS last semester. Would it be possible to combine those with python to create something for my final project?
